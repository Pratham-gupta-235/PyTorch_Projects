## Overview üåü

This repository provides a collection of PyTorch-based models for solving various classification problems. The goal is to show how to apply deep learning models to diverse data types and classification tasks:

- **Tabular Classification**: Predicting labels from structured datasets (e.g., CSV files with numerical/categorical features).
- **Text Classification**: Classifying text into categories (e.g., sentiment analysis or topic classification).
- **Image Classification**: Classifying images into various categories.
- **Image Classification with Pre-trained Models**: Leveraging pre-trained models like ResNet, VGG, or EfficientNet for image classification tasks.
- **Audio Classification**: Classifying audio data into categories (e.g., sound classification, speech recognition).

Each project comes with pre-defined datasets, training scripts, and detailed instructions for training and evaluation.

## Technologies Used ‚öôÔ∏è

- **PyTorch**: The primary framework for building and training deep learning models.
- **Pandas**: For handling tabular data (used in Tabular Classification).
- **NLTK & SpaCy**: NLP libraries for preprocessing text data.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing (used in Image Classification).
- **Librosa**: For audio data processing.
- **Scikit-learn**: For utility functions (e.g., train-test split, metrics).
- **Torchvision**: For pre-trained models and image transformations.
- **Torchaudio**: For audio preprocessing and transformations.

## Projects üõ†Ô∏è

### Tabular Classification üìä

In this project, we use **PyTorch** to build models for classifying tabular datasets. These datasets consist of numerical and categorical features that are commonly used in traditional machine learning tasks.

- **Dataset**: You can use your own dataset or public datasets like the [UCI Adult Income dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult).
- **Model**: Simple Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models.
- **Objective**: Build a classification model for structured data.

#### Example Workflow:
1. Load and preprocess your tabular data (using `pandas`).
2. Train a neural network model.
3. Evaluate performance using common metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

### Text Classification üìù

This project applies **PyTorch** to natural language processing (NLP) tasks, specifically text classification. You'll preprocess text data, tokenize it, and classify it into categories.

- **Dataset**: A variety of text datasets such as the [IMDB sentiment classification dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/).
- **Model**: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory), and GRUs (Gated Recurrent Unit).
- **Objective**: Classify text into categories such as sentiment analysis, topic classification, or spam detection.

#### Example Workflow:
1. Load and preprocess text data (using `NLTK` or `SpaCy`).
2. Tokenize text and convert it into numerical representations.
3. Train a sequential model like LSTM or GRU on the tokenized data.
4. Evaluate model performance.

### Image Classification üñºÔ∏è

This project is focused on using **PyTorch** for image classification tasks, where we train models to classify images into multiple categories using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

- **Dataset**: You can use the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) or your own image dataset.
- **Model**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification.
- **Objective**: Classify images into categories such as animals, objects, or other objects.

#### Example Workflow:
1. Load image data using `torchvision`.
2. Preprocess and normalize images.
3. Train a CNN model.
4. Evaluate the model using accuracy, precision, recall, etc.

### Image Classification with Pre-trained Models üñºÔ∏èüîÑ

In this project, we take advantage of **pre-trained models** such as ResNet, VGG, and EfficientNet to classify images. These models are already trained on large datasets (e.g., ImageNet) and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks, which can significantly speed up training.

- **Dataset**: Use your own image dataset or popular datasets like [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) or [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/).
- **Model**: Pre-trained models such as ResNet, VGG, and EfficientNet available in `torchvision.models`.
- **Objective**: Fine-tune a pre-trained model to classify your specific images.

#### Example Workflow:
1. Load the pre-trained model (e.g., ResNet18, VGG16).
2. Replace the final layer(s) with a classifier that matches your specific number of classes.
3. Fine-tune the model on your dataset.
4. Evaluate the model‚Äôs performance.

#### Example Usage:
```bash
python image_classification_pretrained/train.py --model resnet18 --epochs 10 --batch_size 32
```

### Audio Classification üéß

In this project, we apply deep learning to **audio classification**. This can include tasks such as recognizing spoken commands, identifying musical genres, or detecting environmental sounds.

- **Dataset**: Datasets like [UrbanSound8K](https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/urbansound8k.html) or your own audio dataset.
- **Model**: CNNs and RNNs applied to audio features like Mel spectrograms, MFCCs (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients), or raw waveforms.
- **Objective**: Classify audio clips into categories (e.g., speech commands, musical genres, environmental sounds).

#### Example Workflow:
1. Load audio data using `torchaudio`.
2. Preprocess the audio data into Mel spectrograms or MFCC features.
3. Train a CNN or RNN model for classification.
4. Evaluate the model‚Äôs performance.

#### Example Usage:
```bash
python audio_classification/train.py --epochs 15 --batch_size 64 --lr 0.0001
```

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

To set up this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pytorch-classification-projects.git
   cd pytorch-classification-projects
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. You're all set! üéâ

## Usage üì°

After installation, you can run each classification project separately. For example, to run the **Tabular Classification** project:

```bash
python tabular_classification/train.py
```

Similarly, for **Text Classification**, **Image Classification**, and **Audio Classification**, navigate to the respective directories and execute the training script.

To use pre-trained models for **Image Classification**, you would use:

```bash
python image_classification_pretrained/train.py --model resnet18 --epochs 10 --batch_size 32
```

### Example Training Command for Audio Classification:
```bash
python audio_classification/train.py --epochs 20 --batch_size 64
```

## Training üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

For training any model, make sure you:

1. Prepare the dataset (e.g., load, preprocess, and augment data).
2. Configure hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.
3. Run the appropriate training script (`train.py`).
4. Monitor the training and validation performance.

Pre-trained models for image classification can be fine-tuned with a few lines of code by modifying the final layers and optimizing with your dataset.
